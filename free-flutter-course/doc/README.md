Where my thought processes live. Here you'll find my notes while learning dart using the tutorial mentioned before.

## Who benefits most from this

This repo is not beginner friendly, even thought the course it is associated with is quite friendly to people who know little to do with IT and development. \
This repo is best for somewhat seasoned developers who have built some projects here and there and are somewhat familiar with how the 'IT Game' goes. People who understand most of the fundamentals like OOP concepts and understand the fundamental nature of IT, that is continuous learning.
